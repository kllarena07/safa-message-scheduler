This project was inspired to help my club members in SAFA. 

When making announcements, I found it would be helpful to have a tool where we could schedule Discord announcements, which is the inspiration for this project.

# Running this app

> Note: I use [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation) for my package manager to save disk space on my computer, please use it when working with this project.

`frontend` is just basic NextJS 15 application. As such:

1. `cd frontend`
2. `pnpm install`
3. `pnpm run dev`

Make sure to also use the necessary environment variables and store them in a `.env.local` file. DM me on Discord for the env vars.
